This is official cargo Book: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/>

Some Basic Commands

- ```cargo new <project-name>``` to create project.
- ```cargo build```  to build project (build when new dependencies are added).
- ```cargo run``` to build & run project in one step.
- ```cargo check``` to build project without producing binary. It is used to
  check if the code is working properly as cargo run might take more time to do the same task.
- Cargo saves the result of your code in `target/debug`  directory.
